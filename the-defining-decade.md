by Meg Jay

To get the most out of the book, I recommend to [buy it](https://www.amazon.de/Defining-Decade-Meg-Jay/dp/1782114920/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+defining+decade&qid=1649273605&sprefix=the+defi%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-1) and read through it by yourself.

## Work

### Identity Capital

- identity capital is our collection of personal assets
- about investments we make in ourselves\
  -> things we do well enough for a longer period of time\
  -> so that they become part of who we are
- examples of identity capital:
  - those that go on résumé: degrees, jobs, test scores, clubs
  - personal: how we speak, look, solve problems
- construct a stronger identity by exploring and making commitments at the same time\
  -> don't spent too much time in "disengaged confusion" (Erikson)\
- "underemployed twentysomethings tells us that those who are underemployed for as little as nine months tend to be more depressed and less motivated than their peers - than even their unemployed peers." (Page 12)
- 2/3 of lifetime wage groth happens in the first ten year of a career
- "The only way to figure out what to do is to do - something." (Page 14)

### Weak Ties

- "it is the people we know the least who will be the most transformative. New things almost always come from outside your inner circle." (Page 25)
- "The Strength of Weak Ties" - people we do not know well will add an unique value to our lifes
- urban tribe - the people we know and like to hang around with regularly, are really good to have, but won't help us thrive
- "Weakness of Strong Ties" - our close friends hold us back
- "Everything can change in a day. Especially if you put yourself out there." (Page 26)
- Put yourself out there to get to know to different people, tasks, events, topics\
  -> "The more we know about the way things work, the more we feel a part of things" (Page 27)
- "If weak ties do favors for us, they start to like us." (Page 28)
- research shows: our social network narrows down across adulthood\
  -> in your twenties you should connect with people that might see things a little differently (see Page 30)

### The Unthought Known

### My Life Should Look Better on Facebook

- Don't do what you think you should be doing. Do things that feel authentic.

### The Customized Life

## Love

## The Brain and The Body
