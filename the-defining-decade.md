# The Defining Decade - Why your Twenties matter and How to make the Most of them Now

by Meg Jay

To get the most out of the book, I recommend to [buy it](https://www.amazon.de/Defining-Decade-Meg-Jay/dp/1782114920/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+defining+decade&qid=1649273605&sprefix=the+defi%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-1) and read through it by yourself.

"In my experience, these are the most uncertain and some of the most difficult years of life." (Page 42)

"High school and our twenties are not only the time when we have our most self-defining experiences, study after study shows they are also the time when we have our most self-defining memories. Adolescence is a time of many firsts, including our first attempt to form life stories." (Page 107)

## Work

### Identity Capital

- identity capital is our collection of personal assets
- about investments we make in ourselves\
  -> things we do well enough for a longer period of time\
  -> so that they become part of who we are
- examples of identity capital:
  - those that go on résumé: degrees, jobs, test scores, clubs
  - personal: how we speak, look, solve problems
- construct a stronger identity by exploring and making commitments at the same time\
  -> don't spent too much time in "disengaged confusion" (Erikson)\
- "underemployed twentysomethings tells us that those who are underemployed for as little as nine months tend to be more depressed and less motivated than their peers - than even their unemployed peers." (Page 12)
- 2/3 of lifetime wage groth happens in the first ten year of a career
- "The only way to figure out what to do is to do - something." (Page 14)

### Weak Ties

- "it is the people we know the least who will be the most transformative. New things almost always come from outside your inner circle." (Page 25)
- "The Strength of Weak Ties" - people we do not know well will add an unique value to our lifes
- urban tribe - the people we know and like to hang around with regularly, are really good to have, but won't help us thrive
- "Weakness of Strong Ties" - our close friends hold us back
- "Everything can change in a day. Especially if you put yourself out there." (Page 26)
- Put yourself out there to get to know to different people, tasks, events, topics\
  -> "The more we know about the way things work, the more we feel a part of things" (Page 27)
- "If weak ties do favors for us, they start to like us." (Page 28)
- research shows: our social network narrows down across adulthood\
  -> in your twenties you should connect with people that might see things a little differently (see Page 30)

### The Unthought Known

- Christopher Bollas: "Unthought knowns are those things we know about ourselves but forget somehow. These are the dreams we have lost sight of or the thruths we sense but don't say out loud." (Page 39)
- not making choices isn't safe, the consequences are just further away in time. (see Page 40)

### My Life Should Look Better on Facebook

- Don't do what you think you should be doing. Do things that feel authentic.\
  -> your goals will direct you from the inside while the shoulds ('I should be doing...') are paralyzing judgments from the outside (see Page 47)\
  -> goals feel like authentic dreams, shoulds feel like oppressive obligations (see Page 47)
- "If we only wanted to be happy, it would be easy; but we want to be happier than other people, which is almost always difficult, since we think them happier than they are." - Charles de Montesquieu, writer/ philosopher
- "stop worrying about how life was supposed to look" (Page 48)


### The Customized Life

- You can't build an identity or career around what you don't want. (see Page 56)
- "Being against something is easy [...] What are you for?" (Page 56)
- "Interviewers want to hear a reasonable story about the past, present, and future." (Page 63)\
  -> in your twenties life is still more about potential than proof\
- "Life does not need to be linear but it does, as this executive said, need to make sense." (Page 63)
- "Claiming a career or getting a job isn't the end; it's the beginning." (Page 66)

## Love

# An Upmarket Conversation

- "The most important decision any of us make is who we marry." - David Brooks, political and cultural commentator\
  -> happiness depends more on whom you marry than which college you attend\
  -> since by choosing your partner and the one you will marry, you choose all adult things like money, work, lifestyle, family, health, leisure, retirement (see Page 72)

# Picking Your Family

- "Other things may change us, but we start and end with family." - Anthony Brandt, writer
- "greatest twentysomething opportunities: picking and creating our families." (Page 88)

# The Cohabitation Effect

- "Living together is a good test for marriage. This is a common misperception." (Page 90)
- Cohabitation Effect: Couples who live together before marriage (those that live together before being clearly and mutually committed to each other) are statistically less satisfied with their marriage and more likely to get a divorce than couples who didn't live together before marriage. (see Page 91)
- Lock-in Effect because of cohabitation: "decreased likelihood to search for other options, or change to another option, once an investment in something has been made." (Page 96)\
  -> cohabitation comes with setup and switching costs = basic ingredients of lock-in
- learning: get clear on each person's commitment level before you move in (see Page 99)

# Being in Like

- "People love those who are like themselves." - Aristotle, philosopher
- "What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility." - Leo Tolstoy, writer
- Being in Like: two things (see Page 114)
  - being alike in ways that matter
  - genuinely liking who the other person is
- "the more similiar two people are, the more they are able to understand each other." (Page 114)
- typically we select partners according to our own deal breakers\
  -> deal breakers are our "own personal sine qua non in relationships. They are qualities - almost always similiarities - you feel are nonnegotiable." (Page 116)\
  -> example deal breakers: socioeconomic status, education, age, ethnicity, religion, attractiveness, attitudes, values, intelligence, hobbies, politics (see Page 115 and Page 117)\
  -> deal breakers bring us together, but they don't necessarily make us happy (see Page 116)
-  to be happy in a relationship personality is important to consider (see Page 116)\
  -> "Personality is not about what we have done or even about what we like. It is about how we are in the world, and this infuses everything we do. Personality is the part of ourselves that we take everywhere, [...] so it is worth knowing something about." (Page 117)
- "What do you want" -> deal breakers; "Who are you" -> match makers (see Page 117)
- The Big Five (of personality) refer to five factors that describe how people interact with the world, they are about who you are and how you live:\
  -> Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism\
  -> figure out highs, mediums, lows to get general profile of your personality
- "There is no right or wrong personality, there is just your personality and how it fits with the personalities of other people." (Page 119f)
- "There will always be differences of some kind but, statistically speaking, that's not what will kill a relationship. It's what you do with the differences." (Page 127)
